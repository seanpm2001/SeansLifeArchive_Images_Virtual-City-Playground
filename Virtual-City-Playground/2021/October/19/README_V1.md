I started playing this game again today when browsing through games last night. I had nostalgia for it from my 2015 sessions, and I plan to continue playing the game until I can recreate progress, and possible then some. - 2021 Sunday October 17th

I continued to play this game today, making additional progress. I worked on the pie in the sky achievement, reached level 9, did lots of construction, completed several quests, and did many upgrades. I earned over a million dollars while offline. - 2021 Monday October 18th
