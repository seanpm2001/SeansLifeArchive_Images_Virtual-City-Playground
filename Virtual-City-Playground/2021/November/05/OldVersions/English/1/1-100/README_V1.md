I have stopped playing Virtual City Playground today. I planned for it to be a temporary thing anyways. The game wouldn't load on the first 2 attempts today, and I decided it wasn't worth it to keep trying. I have already made all the progress I wanted to make, getting back up to where I was in 2015, and then some. Progress has been getting slower and slower, and it just isn't fun anymore. So this is goodbye.

I want to try to have more daily games from now on, as this was pretty fun.
